Adding more optional features in this version of YelpCamp!

The original YelpCamp (/WebDevBootcamp/YelpCamp/v1) is the version preceding all of these optional features.

Added features:
- Deployed this version? Maybe add features, then deploy a copy of this version?
- User Profiles
	-> Also added edit routes/template (had to add checkUser middleware?)
	-> Added pre-hook middleware for User Deletion (deleting associated cgs/comments) to User Model file
- Stripe

I EXPORTED THIS TO VS CODE!! (This is the v2copy as of now. I duplicated v2 from iCloud and moved the copy to /Documents on local drive (Joo's Mac))
